# ISA-uProcessor
C++ simulation of a simple uprocessor defined by its instruction set architecture

I had this homework for Microelectronical designing. 
You can find the ISA in the .xls and my implementation in the other files.
For now my processor is not able to use numbers less than zero. We could say this makes it unusable but I only need to implement a 
coder-decoder of two's complement to make it work since all the registers and memories are big enough to store this kind of data.
